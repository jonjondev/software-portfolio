			<p class="section-heading">More About Me</p>
			<p class="section-body">
				Based in <mark>Sydney, Australia</mark>, I am a recent <mark>graduate of an honours degree by research</mark> at UTS, having written my <mark>thesis on interactive drama systems</mark> in video games. I was particularly interested in building games that lean into emergent properties to provide players with dramatically interesting gameplay. As a result, my work was <mark>published at the IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) 2020</mark> for a paper titled "A Review of Agency Architectures in Interactive Drama Systems".
				<br><br>
				Previously I had graduated from the <mark>University of Technology Sydney</mark>, with a Distinction in <mark>BSc. Information Technology</mark>, majoring in enterprise systems development and particularly focusing on <mark>web/mobile apps development as well as interaction design</mark>. Throughout the course I was afforded the opportunity to build up a broad skillset in various programming languages, frameworks and techniques in software engineering.
				<br><br>
				In early 2019 I was also <mark>invited to present a game narrative review paper I had written at GDC</mark>, winning gold for my critical analysis of the game <i>Aviary Attorney</i> as selected by a panel of industry veteran narrative designers. And in 2020 I was named as one of the <mark>Australian Financial Review's (AFR) Top 100 Future Leaders</mark>, a competition that identifies the most promising graduates across multiple disciplines each year.
				<br><br>
				I love <mark>programming</mark> and enjoy spending my free time learning new tools and languages, which has provided me with a great deal of flexibility with regard to the kinds of projects I am able to work on, from games, to networking tools, and even analytics. However I also enjoy (and have experience with) a broad range of creative fields, including: <mark>gameplay and narrative design</mark>, <mark>UX&I design</mark>, music production and composition, and video editing.
				<br><br>
				If you were to ask me about what gets me out of bed in the morning, I would say it's making cool stuff. At my core, I am a creator, and I love to craft experiences, software, games, and many more amazing things. I've developed a passion for learning in service of creation, so if I'm not working hard on one of my projects, I'm likely at a game jam, learning a new skill, or off hiking somewhere.

The paper is a <mark>review of the interactive drama field</mark> in video games research, re-framing the field's key literature as existing upon a spectrum based on their use of scripted or emergent properties - theorising and proposing a new style of hybrid, emergent-scripted solution to drama manager design.<br><br>During the conference, I delivered a recorded <mark>presentation, summarising the paper's content</mark>, findings, and providing additional background on the research area of the interactive drama field.
